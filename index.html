            <p>Hello, my name is Anh. Pronounced as Anne. I was born in Quebec and raised in BC. My hobbies include exercising, playing volleyball, cleaning, and listening to music. 
               I graduated with a Kinesiology diploma at Langara and I hope to use my knowledge and incorporate Kinesiology to CIT.

        <div class="three"><p>I am <strong>very</strong> excited to be in the CIT program. Fundamental Web Technologies is my <em>favourite</em> course in Term 1. 
                            My interest has grown with web development that I want to start my own personal project by incorporating everything I have and will learn in this course.
