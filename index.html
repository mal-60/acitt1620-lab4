            <p>Hello, my name is Anh. Pronounced as Anne. I was born in Quebec and raised in BC. My hobbies include exercising, playing volleyball, cleaning, and listening to music. <br> 
                I graduated with a Kinesiology diploma at Langara and I hope to you my knowledge and incorporate Kinesiology to CIT. <br>
                I am <strong>very</strong> excited to be in the CIT program. Fundamental Web Technologies is my <em>favourite</em> course in Term 1. <br>
